# Matrix Transpose Tool

This small utility generates an editable matrix in the browser and computes its transpose on demand. It is a front-end-only tool built with plain HTML, minimal CSS styling, and a short JavaScript module that dynamically builds the matrix UI based on the user-specified rows and columns. The transpose function collects values and prints a transposed matrix as an output table.

Features

- Dynamically change the shape of the input matrix and enter numbers into each cell.
- Click the "Transpose" button to render the transposed output instantly.
- Small, self-contained code ideal for teaching or quick demonstrations about matrix operations.

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server required).

Extensibility

- Add validation and error messages for non-numeric inputs or empty cells.
- Consider export/import CSV functionality, keyboard accessibility, and a small interactive tutorial for students.
