# IRCTC Mockup (Train Ticket Booking Frontend)

This project is a static, front-end mockup resembling a train-ticket booking interface similar to IRCTC. It’s implemented with plain HTML and CSS and is intended to demonstrate common booking interface patterns: hero section, booking input box, a set of linked services, and information panels. No backend or API integration is included; the form fields are for UI simulation and style demonstrations only.

Features and design

- Prototype booking form supporting 'from' and 'to' text fields, date input, class selection, and quota selection.
- A services grid displays additional offerings like hotels, buses, flights, and e-catering in a card layout.
- Clean responsive styles using CSS Grid and a primary color palette to emulate a polished app design.

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (no server required).

Notes & Suggestions

- To convert this into a real application, add the backend APIs, station suggestions, PNR status lookup, user authentication, and secure payment integration.
- Consider adding client-side validation, station autocomplete using a datalist or typeahead, and accessibility improvements (aria attributes and keyboard navigation).
